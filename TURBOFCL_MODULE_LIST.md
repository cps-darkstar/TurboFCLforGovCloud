## Module Integration Architecture

All modules are designed to work together in a cohesive ecosystem:

- **Backend Integration Modules** handle external API communications and data processing
- **Frontend Modules** provide user-facing interfaces and experiences  
- **Infrastructure Modules** ensure secure, scalable, and compliant deployment
- **Security & Compliance Modules** maintain regulatory adherence and data protection
- **AI Agent Integration Modules** enhance functionality with intelligent automation

Each module can be developed independently while maintaining well-defined interfaces for seamless integration within the TurboFCL platform.
