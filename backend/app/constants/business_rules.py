"""Business-rule constants for the backend.

NOTE:  This is *not* a 1-to-1 port of the rich front-end rules defined in
`frontend/src/constants/businessRules.ts`.  It only contains the fields that
are currently referenced by backend code (e.g. `ENTITY_REQUIREMENTS`).  If the
backend evolves to need the full rule-set you can safely expand this module or
import from a shared source via an internal package.
